OOPS:
    ->Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm in which everything is represented as real world entities.It is generally implemented using classes and objects.
    ->An object is an instantiation of a class. In terms of variables, a class would be the type, and an object would be the variable.
    ->The properties and functions of entities that are usually similar are generally represented using the same class.For Example we can have a class named person. We can have mutliple objects(persons).

Access Specifiers:
    -> Public 
    -> Protected
    -> Private

Defining member function outside the class:
    -> Can be done with the help of :: keyword.
    -> Inside the class only the declaration of the function is done

Friend Function:
    -> Friends are functions or classes declared with the friend keyword.
    -> A non-member function can access the private and protected members of a class if it is declared a friend of that class. That is done by including a declaration of this external function within the class, and preceding it with the keyword friend.

Friend classes:
    -> Similar to friend functions, a friend class is a class whose members have access to the private or protected members of another class.

Encapsulation:
    ->Encapsulation is one of the key features of object-oriented programming. It involves the bundling of data members and functions inside a single class.
